# Genetic-disorder-predictor
An interactive genetic disorder predictor using Punnett Squares. Built with Python + Gradio. Supports single prediction, CSV batch mode, visual charts, and genotype/phenotype analysis.
# 🧬 Genetic Disorder Predictor – Punnett Square Probability Tool

This project is an interactive **Genetic Disorder Predictor** built using **Python** and **Gradio**.  
It calculates genetic disorder probabilities using **Punnett Squares**, based on parent genotypes.

The tool supports:
- Single genetic probability prediction  
- Full CSV batch analysis  
- Automatic genotype/phenotype classification  
- Punnett square visualisation  
- Genotype frequency bar chart  
- Phenotype distribution pie chart  

---

## 🚀 Features

### ⭐ **1. Single Prediction Mode**
Enter:
- Parent 1 genotype (e.g., CC, Cc, cc)
- Parent 2 genotype

And get:
- Punnett square  
- Genotype probability table  
- Phenotype distribution  
- Visual charts  

---

### ⭐ **2. Batch Survey Mode**
Upload a CSV file:

The tool automatically generates probability results for each row.

---

### ⭐ **3. Clean Web GUI (Gradio)**
- Runs locally in your browser  
- No terminal needed  
- Works directly by clicking **Run** in PyCharm / VS Code  
- Mobile-friendly GUI

## 📦 Installation

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Install dependencies:


---

## 🧬 How It Works
The predictor:
1. Canonicalizes genotypes (CC, Cc, cc)
2. Generates gametes
3. Constructs a 2×2 Punnett Square
4. Computes genotype frequencies
5. Classifies phenotypes:
   - Normal  
   - Carrier  
   - Affected  
6. Displays results with charts
